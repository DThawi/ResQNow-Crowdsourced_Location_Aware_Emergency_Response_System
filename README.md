🚨 ResQNow – Smart Emergency Response System 

🌍 A Community-Driven, Real-Time Emergency Coordination Platform 

📌 1️⃣ Introduction

Emergencies such as 🌪 natural disasters and 🚗 road accidents occur unexpectedly and require immediate response from relevant authorities. However, crucial information regarding these incidents is often scattered, delayed, or unreliable.

Traditional reporting methods like 📞 phone calls or 📱 social media posts can lead to:

❌ Miscommunication

❌ Duplicate reports

❌ Delayed verification

❌ Inefficient responder coordination

Most existing emergency reporting systems rely heavily on manual verification processes, which increases response time. Additionally, they lack mechanisms to evaluate the credibility of public reports, treating all submissions equally without assessing trustworthiness.

There is currently no integrated, trust-aware platform that combines:

✔ Public reporting 

✔ Community validation 

✔ Automated responder alerting 

✔ Real-time visualization

🚀 Enter ResQNow

ResQNow is a comprehensive digital emergency response platform designed to solve these challenges.

It introduces:

🔹 A crowdsourced verification mechanism 

🔹 An automated dispatch system 

🔹 Real-time data visualization

Together, these features enhance the speed, accuracy, and coordination of emergency response efforts.

📲 How It Works

Citizens can report incidents in real time by submitting:

🏷 Incident Type

📍 Location

📝 Description

🖼 Optional Images

All reports are stored in a centralized database and displayed on a live interactive map.

👮 Emergency responders and authorities monitor, verify, and act upon incidents through dedicated dashboards — ensuring faster and more effective emergency management.

🌊 Scalable for Multiple Emergency Types

ResQNow supports various emergency scenarios, including:

🚗 Road Accidents

🔥 Fires

🌊 Floods

⛰ Landslides

⚠ Other Disaster Events 


🎯 2️⃣ Project Objectives

The primary goal of ResQNow is to improve the speed, accuracy, and coordination of emergency response activities through a crowdsourced digital ecosystem.

🔑 Key Objectives

🔹 Provide intuitive 📱 mobile applications for Citizens and Responders 

🔹 Develop a 💻 web dashboard for Admins 

🔹 Enable real-time incident reporting with detailed information 

🔹 Implement a centralized incident management system 

🔹 Establish an automated proximity-based alert & dispatch mechanism 

🔹 Integrate a crowdsourced verification system to reduce false reports 

🔹 Implement secure authentication using 🔐 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 

🔹 Provide analytics and data visualization for authorities 

🔹 Allow responders to acknowledge alerts and update statuses 

🔹 Ensure scalability using ☁ cloud-based infrastructure 

🔹 Encourage community participation in real-time emergency data collection 


🌟 3️⃣ Novelty of ResQNow

ResQNow introduces innovative features that distinguish it from traditional emergency reporting systems. 


1️⃣ Crowdsourced Verification Engine

  Users can upvote or flag incidents, generating a Verification Score that improves credibility and reduces misinformation. 


2️⃣ Automated Dispatch Based on Verification

  Responders are notified only after an incident reaches a defined verification threshold — reducing unnecessary alerts. 


3️⃣ Real-Time Incident Clustering & Risk Identification

  Verified incidents are visually clustered on a live map to improve situational awareness and assist in faster decision-making. 


4️⃣ Trust Badges & Credibility Tracking

  Each reporter has an internal credibility score, increasing trust for reliable contributors. 


5️⃣ Multi-Level Real-Time Map Visualization

  Incident heatmaps 

  Severity-based color coding

  Responder movement tracking 


6️⃣ Automated Proximity-Based Routing

The system automatically:

 Identifies the nearest verified responders

 Generates routing instructions

 Logs all alerts for transparency 


7️⃣ Cloud-Native Scalability

 Designed for high performance, capable of handling thousands of concurrent reports in real time.

8️⃣ Community-Driven Emergency Ecosystem

 Transforms citizens from passive observers into active participants in disaster management.

 ResQNow combines technology, community intelligence, and real-time coordination to build a safer, smarter society.   

 # ResQNow – Crowdsourced Disaster Response & Emergency Coordination Platform

##  Project Overview

ResQNow is a crowdsourced disaster management and emergency coordination platform designed to enhance real-time incident reporting, verification, and response management in Sri Lanka.  

The system enables citizens to report disasters, authorities to verify incidents, and responders to coordinate actions efficiently. ResQNow focuses on improving response speed, transparency, trust, and preparedness during critical situations such as floods, landslides, road accidents, and extreme weather events.

---

##  Problem Statement

Sri Lanka frequently experiences natural disasters and emergency situations, particularly during monsoon seasons. Existing systems primarily focus on reporting incidents but lack:

- Structured verification mechanisms
- Real-time response transparency
- Resource capacity awareness
- Data-driven risk analysis
- Accountability in emergency handling

Additionally, misinformation and duplicate reporting reduce the effectiveness of crowdsourced disaster platforms.

ResQNow aims to address these limitations through a structured, trust-aware, and analytics-driven approach.
